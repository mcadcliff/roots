            <p>ROOTS solves the problem of inaccessible access to valuable information about food sources. Having access to data about food origins and their benefits is important to give users control over their choices around the food that they consume. ROOTS serves as an informational guide for users by providing fundamental data that doesn’t exist within the food industry for day-to-day users. ROOTS provides a solution to finding information about food that connects cultures and cuisine.</p>
