            <p>ROOTS solves the problem of inaccessible access to valuable information about food sources. Having access to data about food origins and their benefits is important to give users control over their choices around the food that they consume.</p>

            <p>ROOTS serves as an informational guide for users by providing fundamental data that doesn’t exist within the food industry for day-to-day users. ROOTS provides a solution to finding information about food that connects cultures and cuisine.</p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Food and curiosity were the seeds to start ROOTS. Sharing food with family and friends is an important interaction for sustainable life. I wanted to create a connective piece on information about food for people to share. The development of ROOTS is a growing project for the purpose of educating people about food history, to culminate genealogies of food as a resource. Digital and print mediums serve to provide accessible spaces where ROOTS can live and grow in the design community.</p>
